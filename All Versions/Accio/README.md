# Accio Code - Spawn anything, anywhere
By Chadderz and MrBean35000vr

These are a series of codes designed to allow the user to spawn arbitrary objects at any location in Zelda: Breath of the Wild for Wii
U.

The Accio Master Code (**MasterCode**) should be switched on after you have spawned in the world (so after loading your game, or appearing in the Shrine
of Resurrection if it's a new game) and should always be left on. Then, either run a script code from below, or go to 
http://wild.chadsoft.co.uk/accio.html for a little interface to make your own. When a script code is run, the master code will spawn
the objects from the script code. You can only run one script code at once. You should disable a script code before running another 
one, or nothing will happen. You can also re-run scripts by turning them off, then on again, in JGecko U's code interface. (Please note 
that you must click "Send codes" after disabling or enabling a script for the game to notice the change). The Accio Master Code has no
need to be disabled at any point.

This code also supports manual spawning if you're an advanced user or a hipster. Enter an ASCII string name (in hex) at 10024060 and 
then poke a quantity at 10024038, and the code will spawn it without any need of scripts. I don't know why anyone would do this though,
since scripts are way easier.
